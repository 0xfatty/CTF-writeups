Here are my notes from learning tools:

 - [Radare2](radare2/README.md)

The following is an ever-growing list of tools you should know about:

 - [PwnDbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) GDB module -- Python module that allows for advanced GDB commands, visual modes, and generally useful functionality that should have already been built in
 - [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) is the predecessor to PwnDbg -- Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB.
 - [Radare2](http://radare.org/r/) is a rewrite of Radare and allows for disassembling and debugging of most any binary format and archtecture.
 - [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org) disassembler -- engine that allows a number of utilities (including Unicorn) to reverse engineer and analyze executable binaries in a variety of architectures
 - [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org) emulator -- uses QEMU to allow you to debug executables with different architectures (x86, x64, ARM, ARM64, MIPS, PowerPC, Sparc, ...) and from different platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, ...)
